BBC

In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic. Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered. At least, so far. Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases. Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt. What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term.

The '90 deals in 90 days' deadline

For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs. While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted ""90 deals in 90 days"" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was. By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations.

The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK. While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone. And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs. South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt ""thank you for your attention to this matter"".

Capacity to 'damage' the global economy

Much has been revealed as a result of this. First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised.

Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse. For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers. That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining.

But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago. Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades. The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to ""damage"" the global economy in several ways. ""They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,"" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods.

Winners and losers: Germany, India and China

It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor. The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year. That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession.

Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production. On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries. Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere. And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line. For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.

A very real political threat for Trump?

As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too. Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year.

Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year. American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US

Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them. Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain. Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval. It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections.

The deals yet to be hammered out

Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved. Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning. Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on. In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president.

YURI GRIPAS/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Trump's overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success

When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the ""devil is in the detail"" – and the details are light. It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots. But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally. Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US. Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth. Additional reporting: Michael Race.

"US envoy to visit Gaza, as hospital says dozens killed seeking food","US envoy to visit Gaza, as hospital says dozens killed seeking food

'I invite Mr Witkoff to see for himself,' says American doctor in Gaza

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 111 people had been killed, 91 of them while seeking aid, in the 24 hours before Thursday midday.

Witkoff, who is on a visit to Israel, also had a ""productive"" meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the press secretary added.

Leavitt said Witkoff would visit the territory along with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and ""secure a plan to deliver more food and meet with local Gazans to hear first-hand about this dire situation on the ground"".

US special envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Gaza on Friday to inspect food distribution sites, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed.

Shortly after his envoy's arrival in Israel, US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: ""The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!""

Israeli officials have threatened that if there is no progress in the coming days on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, then they may take new punitive steps against Hamas. Israeli media reported that those could include annexing parts of Gaza.

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said Israeli forces fired at the crowds gathered around aid lorries. The Israeli military said troops fired ""warning shots"" but that it was ""not aware of any casualties"".

Footage showed casualties from the incident near the Zikim crossing being taken on carts to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.

A hospital director told the BBC that more than 50 Palestinians were killed and 400 others injured while waiting for food near a crossing in northern Gaza on Wednesday.

Witkoff's Gaza visit is 'reflection of close work' US has been doing, says State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce

Witkoff will visit Gaza a day after his meeting with Netanyahu, where they focused on ""dilemmas"" such as food and aid in Gaza, Leavitt said.

The announcement comes after reports that he would visit food distribution sites run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

In Gaza, the health ministry said on Thursday that 111 people had been killed and 820 others injured by Israel's military offensive in the last 24 hours.

In a separate statement, the ministry said two people had died of malnutrition in the past day, bringing the total number of malnutrition deaths since the start of the war to 159, including 90 children.

On Tuesday, UN-backed global food security experts warned that the ""worst-case scenario of famine"" was ""currently playing out"" among the 2.1 million population.

UN agencies have said there is man-made, mass starvation in Gaza and blamed Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies to Gaza. But Israel has insisted that there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is ""no starvation"".

Despite that, four days ago it implemented measures that it has said are aimed at helping the UN and its partners collect aid from crossings and distribute it within Gaza, including daily ""tactical pauses"" in military operations in three areas and the creation of what it calls ""designated humanitarian corridors"".

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday that 43 aid packages containing food for residents in southern and northern Gaza had been airdropped, and ""it would continue to work in order to improve the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip, along with the international community"".

The UN's humanitarian office has said the tactical pauses do not allow for the continuous flow of supplies required to meet the immense needs of the population, and that desperately hungry crowds continue to offload supplies from lorries as they pass through Israeli crossings.

The director of al-Shifa hospital, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told the BBC on Thursday morning that it had received the bodies of 54 people who were killed in the incident in the Zikim area on Wednesday, as well as 412 injured people.

On Wednesday night, the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told AFP news agency that at least 30 people were killed when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd waiting for aid there.

The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its al-Saraya field hospital and al-Quds hospital in Gaza City had received a total of six dead and 274 injured from the same incident.

The IDF said in a statement that ""dozens of Gazans was identified gathering around aid trucks in northern Gaza, and in close proximity to IDF troops operating in the area"".

""The troops fired warning shots in the area, not directed at the gathering, in response to the threat posed to them,"" it added.

""According to an initial inquiry, the IDF is not aware of any casualties as a result of IDF fire. The details of the incident are still being examined.""

International journalists are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so it is difficult to verify what happened.

However, one man interviewed by a local freelance journalist working for the BBC said he knew a teenage boy who was killed.

""In the current situation, there is no food or water. People go to get food from the Zikim area, where they are targeted. He went to bring flour but came back carried in the flour bag,"" he said.

""What was his fault? They sniped him in the middle of his head. He wasn't carrying a rock, or a weapon, or doing anything wrong. His only fault was being Palestinian and living in Gaza.""

Abu Taha al-Kafarneh, a unemployed father of two who was the main breadwinner for his family, was also among the dead, another man told the BBC.

""He went to get a bag of flour to secure his food for the day... He didn't want to trade it, sell it, or profit from it like many of the looting merchants,"" he said.

He added: ""They [Israel] claim they let food in, but instead increase the number of those killed and martyred as much as they can. The morgue is full.""

On Wednesday morning, hospital sources told the BBC that six people were killed near an aid distribution centre run by GHF in the Rafah area.

The IDF told the BBC a ""gathering of suspects"" it said posed a threat to its troops were told to move away, and subsequently the army fired ""warning shots"" at a distance of ""hundreds of metres away"" from the site.

The military also said that ""an initial review suggests that the number of casualties reported does not align with the information held by the IDF"".

The GHF said no killings took place at or near its sites on Wednesday.",2025-08-01 10:46:52.497737,"US envoy to visit Gaza, as hospital says dozens killed seeking food'I invite Mr Witkoff to see for himself,' says American doctor in GazaGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 111 people had been killed, 91 of them while seeking aid, in the 24 hours before Thursday midday.

"Iran drives out 1.5 million Afghans, with some branded spies for Israel","Iran drives out 1.5 million Afghans, with some branded spies for Israel

7 hours ago Share Save BBC News Afghan & BBC Global Disinformation Unit Share Save

BBC Some Afghans in Iran have been accused of espionage in the wake of the 12-day conflict with Israel.

Ali Ahmad's eyes fill with tears as he lifts his shirt to show deep bruises across his back. While he was detained, Iranian officers struck him and accused him of spying, he says. ""They used hoses, water pipes and wooden boards to beat me. They treated us like animals."" He was speaking to the BBC earlier this month at Islam Qala on the two countries' border, before crossing back over to Afghanistan. His name has been changed to protect his identity. Iran - which says it hosts more than four million undocumented Afghans who fled conflict in their homeland - has been stepping up deportations for months. In March those without papers were given a July deadline to depart voluntarily, but since a brief war with Israel in June, the authorities have forcibly returned hundreds of thousands of Afghans, alleging national security concerns. Daily returns peaked at about 50,000 people in early July, according to the United Nations – often after arduous journeys. Ali Ahmad says Iranian officials confiscated his money and phone and left him without ""a single penny to travel back"". He'd lived in Iran for two and a half years.

'Scapegoats'

Iran's crackdown has coincided with widespread accusations linking Afghans to Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, including Iranian media reports that cite police sources claiming some individuals were arrested for espionage. ""We're afraid to go anywhere, constantly worried that we might be labelled as spies,"" one person, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC News Afghan. ""You Afghans are spies"", ""You work for Israel"" or ""You build drones in your homes"", are other frequent accusations, according to this individual. Barnett Rubin, an expert on Afghanistan who served as senior adviser to the US Department of State, says Tehran may be ""looking for scapegoats"" for its shortcomings in the war against Israel. ""The Iranian government is very embarrassed by their security failures"", which show Iran ""was very thoroughly penetrated by Israeli intelligence"", he says. ""So they had to find someone to blame."" Critics also say the accusations of espionage are aimed at buying legitimacy for the government's plan to deport undocumented Afghans. The BBC attempted to contact the Iranian government but did not receive a response. The return of Afghan refugees ""without tension and with respect for human rights… is a goal pursued at all levels"", the state-backed Islamic Republic News Agency said on 18 July.

'Four days, like four years'

Abdullah Rezaee, whose name has also been changed, has a similar story to Ali Ahmad. At the detention centre where he was held, about 15 Iranian officers physically harmed him and other deportees, Abdullah told the BBC at Islam Qala. ""Iranian police tore up my visa and passport and beat me severely. They accused me of being a spy.""

Getty Images It is estimated that there are over 4 million undocumented Afghans living in Iran.

Abdullah says he'd only been in Iran two months before being detained, despite having a visa. ""They beat us with plastic batons and said: 'You're a spy, you're ruining our country'."" The four days he was detained ""felt like four years"". He describes constant mistreatment, physical abuse and lack of food. The online allegations of collaboration between Afghans and Israeli secret services started early in the war. On 13 June, the day Israel attacked Iranian nuclear and military facilities, the government issued statements to the population, asking citizens to report suspicious activities such as unusual movements of vans, which might be transporting Israeli operatives' weapons. Then Telegram channels with large followings posted warning messages using similar wording to the government's. But they added that the population should be vigilant of ""alien citizens"" – an expression mostly used to describe Afghans in Iran – driving vans in big cities. The following day, a series of detentions of people allegedly connected to the Israeli attacks, including some Afghans, were reported. On 16 June, news channels broadcast a video of Afghans being detained claiming that they had been carrying drones with them. It went viral. But the video was old, and portrayed migrants detained due to their undocumented status. On 18 June, a Telegram group attributed to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps posted that 18 Afghans had been arrested in the city of Mashhad for building drones for Israel, according to the independent monitoring group Afghan Witness. The following day, the provincial deputy security chief was quoted saying the arrest had ""no connection to drone-making"" or co-operation with Israel. ""They were arrested solely for being in Iran illegally."" But posts connecting the arrests to espionage had spread widely on social media platforms. A hashtag saying the ""expulsion of Afghans is a national demand"" was shared more than 200,000 times on X in the space of a month, peaking at more than 20,000 mentions on 2 July. Anti-Afghan sentiment on Iranian social media is not new, but the difference this time is ""the misinformation is not just coming from social media users but from Iranian-affiliated media"", according to an independent researcher at Afghan Witness.

ABEDIN TAHERKENAREH/EPA/Shutterstock The conflict started when Israel attacked nuclear and military sites in Iran, and then Iran retaliated with aerial attacks targeting Israel.

From 'serial killers' to 'spies'

More than 1.5 million Afghans have left Iran since January, according to the UN Refugee Agency. A spokesperson from the Taliban's Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation told the BBC that more than 918,000 Afghans entered Afghanistan from Iran between 22 June - 22 July. Some had been in Iran for generations. Millions of Afghans have fled to Iran and Pakistan since the 1970s, with major waves during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and more recently in 2021, when the Taliban returned to power. Experts warn Afghanistan lacks the capacity to absorb the growing number of nationals forcibly returned to a country under Taliban rule. The country is already struggling with a large influx of returnees from Pakistan, which is also forcing hundreds of thousands of Afghans to leave. At first, Afghans were welcomed in Iran, says Dr Khadija Abbasi, who specialises in forced displacement at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. But anti-Afghan sentiment increased gradually, with state media portraying Afghan refugees as an ""economic burden"" to society, she says. False narratives about Afghan migrants in Iran followed suit.

Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis,"Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis

TETIANA DZHAFAROVA/AFP Young Ukrainians were outside parliament again on Thursday as MPs voted to overturn a controversial law

As Ukraine's MPs gathered at parliament in Kyiv on Thursday, some held cardboard signs that read, ""We are with our people."" It was a message to thousands of young protesters who had taken part in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. They were out in force again on Thursday. The MPs then entered parliament, the Rada, and took part in a vote that overwhelmingly overturned a law introduced by President Volodymyr Zelensky last week that curtailed the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies known as Nabu and Sap - the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

Two MPs hold a cardboard placard that reads ""We are with the people""

The signs carried by the MPs outside the Rada were a nod to the placards carried by thousands of young people who had taken to the streets in towns and cities across Ukraine for almost a week. The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his government ""take their hands off"" the two anti-corruption bodies, and they threatened to continue carry on until the government made a U-turn. Within days, it did.

Zelensky's original bill had stripped the two bodies of their independent authority to decide who to prosecute in high-level corruption cases, giving that prerogative to the general prosecutor - a presidential appointee. For the placard-waving protesters, safeguarding the independence of Nabu and Sap was as crucial to their European future as the war against Russia was a matter of life and death for their country. In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate country – but on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. For Ukraine's Western partners, donors and investors who pour money into the country through international assistance and funding programmes, the existence and independence of the two anti-corruption bodies are non-negotiable. And for Ukraine and its war-shattered economy – that external financial help is critical. It was only 10 days earlier that MPs had backed Zelensky's controversial law, and yet they voted on Thursday by 331 to 0 to overturn it. On both occasions they appeared to be following Zelensky's direction. ""Ukraine is a democracy - there are definitely no doubts,"" he said on social media.

Many Ukrainians see the hand of Zelensky's right-hand man, Andriy Yermak, behind the president's recent choices. Yermak's position as head of the presidential office is not regulated by the constitution nor limited by any checks or balances. And questions are being asked about such a role in Ukraine's democracy. Safeguarding that democracy and Ukraine's course towards European integration were the key drivers for the young protesters, while their parents and friends were defending their country on the front lines. MPs did their best to show the problem was now solved, but this crisis has left behind an unpleasant aftertaste. It has brought into question Zelensky's dedication to the anti-corruption reforms. That he seemed ready to compromise on these reforms may have seriously dented the trust the EU put in him.",2025-08-01 10:46:55.571901,"Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis8 hours ago Share Save Zhanna Bezpiatchuk BBC News Ukrainian in Kyiv Share SaveTETIANA DZHAFAROVA/AFP Young Ukrainians were outside parliament again on Thursday as MPs voted to overturn a controversial lawAs Ukraine's MPs gathered at parliament in Kyiv on Thursday, some held cardboard signs that read, ""We are with our people.""

Radioactive wasp nest discovered at old US nuclear weapons site,"Radioactive wasp nest found at old US nuclear weapons site

Investigators say the contamination is not related to a nuclear waste leak, and that there was no impact to ""the environment, or the public"".

""The wasp nest was sprayed to kill wasps, then bagged as radiological waste,"" says a US Department of Energy report released last week. No wasps were found at the site near Aiken in South Carolina.

A radioactive wasp nest with radiation levels ten times of what is allowed under regulations was found at a facility that once produced parts for US nuclear weapons, federal officials said.

The nest was discovered by workers who routinely inspect for nuclear radiation at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, on 3 July.

It was found on a post nearby to where millions of gallons of liquid nuclear waste are stored, but there was no leak from the waste tanks, the report said.

Investigators attribute the dangerously-high levels found on the nest to what is called ""onsite legacy radioactive contamination"" - the residual radioactivity that remains from the time when the site was actively producing parts for nuclear bombs during the Cold War.

The site opened in the 1950s, when it was creating plutonium to be used in the core of nuclear bombs. It continues to operate today, but with a focus on nuclear material for power plants.

The energy department report notes that the wasps that lived within the nest would have significantly lower radiation levels than the nest itself.

It also points out that wasps generally fly only a few hundred feet from their nest, and that the nest was found in the middle of the 310-square-mile Savannah River Site - meaning there is little chance they flew outside of the facility.

""No contamination was found in the area,"" the report notes. ""There were no impacts to workers, the environment or the public,""

Savannah River Site Watch, a watchdog group that monitors the site, said that many questions remain unanswered.

White House A rendering of the new, 650-person ballroom has been described as ""much needed"" by the White House

The White House has announced plans to build a $200m (£151m) new ballroom, fulfilling an often-repeated desire of US President Donald Trump. The new ballroom will be built alongside a ""modernised"" East Wing of the White House, which currently houses the offices of First Lady Melania Trump and other key White House posts. The money will be donated directly by Trump and other so-far anonymous donors, with work beginning in September, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump has repeatedly promised to build a ""beautiful"" ballroom at the White House, and in 2016 offered to pay $100m during Barack Obama's administration - which the then-President rejected.

In a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, Leavitt said that the ""much needed and exquisite addition"" to the White House will be approximately 90,000 (8,360 sq m) with a seating capacity of about 650. Currently, many formal White House functions are held in the White House's East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people. The new ballroom, Leavitt added, would also eliminate the need for a ""large and unsightly tent"" to be installed for state dinners and other large events - which sometimes include world leaders. According to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed ""long before"" the end of Trump's term in office in January 2029. ""The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserving the special history of the White House, while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future administrations and generations of Americans to come,"" Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement.

""The White House has a history of expansion to accommodate the changing needs of the nation's chief executive,"" Leslie Greene Bowman, who has served under four presidents on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, told the BBC. ""I hope and trust that any proposed changes will honor and preserve the existing walls that have witnessed so much history. They are precious vessels of our legacy as a democracy."" Offices currently housed in the East Wing of the White House adjacent to the construction - including that of First Lady Melania Trump - will be temporarily re-located. President Trump has repeatedly voiced his wishes for a new ballroom as part of renovations to the White House, which has already seen the installation of two large flagpoles, new gold decorations in the Oval Office and the bulldozing and paving over of the famed Rose Garden.

US to impose sanctions on Palestinian organisations,"US to deny visas to Palestinian officials

10 hours ago Share Save Tom Bateman State Department correspondent Share Save

AFP The statement came from the office of Marco Rubio's State Department

The US says it is going to impose sanctions on the Palestinians' self-governance organisation as well as the body that represents it on the international stage. The sanctions affect both the Palestinian Authority (PA) which was established by the Oslo peace accords, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) which was recognised after the same process as the official representative of the Palestinian people in return for it recognising Israel and renouncing violence. The State Department said it would deny visas to PLO members and PA officials.

The timing and language of the statement suggest it is the Trump administration's response to this week's French-Saudi led conference at the United Nations held to rally support for a future two state solution. The meeting came as France, the UK and Canada committed to recognising an independent, demilitarised Palestinian state later this year, in some cases subject to certain conditions. The US castigated these moves, having privately warned of diplomatic consequences if those attending the UN conference made ""anti-Israel"" declarations. In its sanctions announcement, the State Department accused the PA and PLO of taking actions to ""internationalise its conflict with Israel such as through the International Criminal Court (ICC) and International Court of Justice (ICJ)"". It also referred to a series of long-standing complaints by the US and Israel that the PLO and PA had continued ""to support terrorism including incitement and glorification of violence (especially in textbooks), and providing payments and benefits in support of terrorism to Palestinian terrorists and their families"". The Trump administration earlier this year lifted sanctions on violent Israeli settlers who have killed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. One leading Palestinian politician described the sanctions move as ""revenge"" by the US for the commitments to recognise Palestinian statehood by a growing number of countries. The PA appeared to echo that sentiment in a statement released on Thursday. ""These campaigns have been escalating in response to the significant and successive achievements of Palestinian diplomacy,"" it said. ""Particularly the recent recognitions of the State of Palestine by key countries, the successful United Nations conference in New York, and the historic declaration issued therein.""

Kyiv toll rises to 26 as wave of Russian strikes defies Trump ceasefire demand,"Kyiv toll rises to 26 after wave of Russian strikes defies Trump ceasefire demand

Watch: Explosions seen in Kyiv during Russian attack

The death toll from a barrage of Russian drones and missiles that struck several districts of Kyiv early on Thursday morning has risen to 26, including three children, while 159 others were wounded, officials said. The attack brought down an apartment block. A six-year-old boy and his mother were among the dead, as more than two dozen locations across the Ukrainian capital were hit. Ukraine's interior ministry said three children had died and 16 were among the wounded. Kyiv's mayor said it was the biggest number of children hurt in one night since the full-scale war began. Russian attacks have continued despite US President Donald Trump's threat to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow if Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire by 8 August.

The toll was revised after ""rescuers retrieved 10 bodies from the rubble of the residential building in Sviatoshynsky district, including the body of a two-year-old child"", Ukraine's interior ministry posted on Telegram. ""Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal,"" acting US representative to the United Nations John Kelley told the UN Security Council on Thursday. ""President Trump has made clear this must be done by 8 August."" The high-pitched hum of Russian drones could be heard for hours over the city, interrupted by the occasional loud thunder clap of a missile strike. Russia launched 309 drones and eight cruise missiles during the night, according to Ukraine's air force. And although officials say air defences did manage to destroy many of them, there were numerous hits including from cruise missiles. A red-orange glow indicated destruction on the ground. These were the biggest airstrikes since Trump brought forward an earlier deadline to Putin. The threat of more US sanctions appears to have done little to persuade the Russian president to change course. Meanwhile, Russia claimed further success on the battlefield, declaring that it had captured the strategically important hilltop town of Chasiv Yar in the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine denied it had fallen, however, and military analysts said fighting there was continuing.

Three of the fatalities in Kyiv were at the site of the residential apartment block. ""An entire entrance was destroyed. Rescuers are clearing the rubble,"" said Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the capital was the focus of Russia's overnight attacks. ""The world has yet again seen Russia's response to our, America's and Europe's desire for peace. More demonstrative murder,"" he said on social media. ""This is why peace without strength is impossible."" Kyiv's Sviatoshynskyi and Solomyansky districts were hit hardest in the attack. The windows of a hospital ward for children in Shevchenkivskyi district were blown out by a shockwave, Kyiv's mayor said on Telegram. One of the city's higher education institutions, a school and a kindergarten were also damaged. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said it was a ""horrible morning"" in Kyiv, and that there are ""still people under the rubble"". Sybiha added that Trump had been ""very generous and patient"" with Putin, but now it was time to put ""maximum pressure on Moscow"" through sanctions.

"EU-US tariff deal not finished yet, say Europeans unhappy with Trump's terms","EU-US tariff deal not finished yet, say Europeans unhappy with Trump's terms

13 hours ago Share Save Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save

Getty Images Since the deal was announced criticism of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has mounted

It was all handshakes and smiles when European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump announced that a EU-US trade agreement had been reached after months of wrangling - beating Trump's deadline of 1 August to make a deal. Many across Europe breathed a sigh of relief that European negotiators had avoided 30% tariffs threatened by Trump months ago. Other countries are still racing to finalise deals with the US to avoid sweeping levies. But since news of the US-EU deal was announced last weekend, not only has criticism mounted, but it has become clear many details are yet to be ironed out, there are several discrepancies between the two sides and some EU countries will be disproportionately affected.

Only a first step?

Few European leaders rejoiced at the announcement that a 15% tariff would be applied on most EU exports to the US - an improvement on the 30% tariff initially threatened by Trump, but still a substantial hike from the former 4.8% average rate.

Yet, while expressing regret that the EU had not adopted a tougher negotiating stance, many begrudgingly agreed the deal had at least brought a semblance of certainty and predictability to Europe's businesses after a number of fraught months. ""I would have wished for a different outcome,"" Germany's finance minister Lars Klingbeil said. ""Still, all in all, it is good that there is an agreement with the US, that there are no further escalations."" As of Thursday, a joint statement had yet to be released, although the Commission has emphasised it will not be a legally binding document but a ""set of political commitments"". ""From there will flow the additional negotiated exemptions that we're looking to bake into our agreement with the US,"" Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill said. The Commission's general outline of the deal stressed it was not legally binding. The White House fact sheet on the agreement presents none of these caveats and says it achieves ""historic structural reforms"", but US Commerce chief Howard Lutnick admitted on Wednesday that talks would continue and that EU and US officials were still discussing some aspects of the framework. ""This isn't the end of the story and we won't leave it at that,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said. ""It's the first step in a negotiation process that will continue."" Trade agreements usually take between 18 and 24 months of bilateral negotiations, says Cinzia Alcidi of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""To give some certainty to the industry and private sectors now, the 15% blanket tariff will apply – but then there will be efforts to get some goods a different deal,"" she says.

Key discrepancies and interpretations

According to the White House, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will fall under the 15% tariff, with no mention of that number being the upper limit. But the EU says the two sectors will remain on the current 0% rate for now and until new global tariff rates are agreed. Any future tariffs, according to the EU, will be capped at 15%. Tariffs on steel and aluminium, according to the US, will remain at 50%. The EU says Brussels and Washington will work to cut that number and that they will be replaced by a quota system to come beyond 1 August. Some of the most glaring discrepancies can be found in the language used by the two sides to describe the EU's investment commitments. Where the US statement says the EU ""will"" purchase $750bn (£568bn) in US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear energy products, the EU says only that it ""intends"" to do so as it weans itself off Russian gas and oil. Not only is it unclear whether the US can even provide such amounts to the EU, says Cinzia Alcidi, but the EU cannot decide purchases on behalf of the private sector. Similarly, the US says the EU will invest $600bn by the end of Trump's second term – but the EU states simply that ""companies have expressed interest"" in investing that sum by 2029. As Brussels cannot force private firms to invest in the US, there is technically no guarantee that amount can or will be reached. According to the US, the EU has ""agreed to purchase significant amounts"" of US military equipment. There is no mention of this in the EU statement. Nearly 80% of the EU's defence investment already goes to the US, and scaling up further may not be possible; besides, such a commitment would be at odds with von der Leyen's recent ReArm Europe plan, which calls for investments in Europe's domestic defence industry. And while negotiations continue, the US will also apply a 15% tariff on wine and spirits, the Commission said on Thursday, adding it would continue to try and achieve a carve-out. On Wednesday, Macron said the agreement had the merit of offering ""predictability in the short term"" - but also called for Europe to be firmer with the US. ""In order to be free you have to be feared. We weren't feared enough,"" he said. Given the amount of detail that still needs hammering out, the next phase of negotiations is set to continue for some time - and after the backlash the Commission received this week, European negotiators may feel under greater pressure to stand their ground.

Swedish jihadist jailed for life over IS murder of Jordanian pilot in Syria,"Swedish jihadist jailed for life over IS murder of Jordanian pilot in Syria

Jordan confirmed he had died after a gruesome IS video appeared to show the 26-year-old being burned alive in a cage.

Jordanian air force pilot Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh was captured when his plane came down in Syria during a mission against the Islamic State (IS) group in 2014.

A court in Stockholm handed down the verdict to Osama Krayem, who had been jailed for the Paris and Brussels attacks in 2015 and 2016.

A Swedish man already convicted of carrying out jihadist attacks in Europe has been jailed for life for ""serious war crimes and terrorist crimes"" over the brutal killing of a pilot in Syria 10 years ago.

Krayem had denied the charges, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported, and said he was unaware of the plans for the killing.

While the evidence showed that the fire that killed Lt Kasasbeh was lit by another man, Krayem was also involved in the killing, the court said.

""The defendant, through his actions, contributed so actively to the death of the pilot that he should be considered a perpetrator,"" presiding Judge Anna Liljenberg Gullesjo said in a statement.

He was at the execution site ""uniformed and armed, and allowed himself to be filmed,"" the statement added.

Krayem, 32, who is already serving a 30-year sentence for his role in the Paris attacks and a life term for the Brussels attacks, was given a second life sentence by the court in Stockholm.

The judge added that Krayem's actions consisted of ""guarding the victim both before and during the execution and taking him to the cage where he was set alight"".

The court also awarded compensation to Lt Kasasbeh's parents and siblings of around 80,000 Swedish kronor ($8,200/£6,198) each.

Lt Kasasbeh was captured when his plane came down near the city of Raqqa during a mission against IS in December 2014.

At the time of his death in early 2015, Jordan - which was part of a US-led coalition fighting IS in Syria - had been attempting to secure his release as part of a prisoner swap.

""It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,"" the pilot's brother, Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, told Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio when charges were initially announced.

Krayem is originally from the Swedish city of Malmo and is thought to have travelled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for IS.

In June 2022, he was sentenced for his role in the November 2015 Paris attacks - in which 130 people were killed - and for planning a separate attack on Amsterdam airport.

Trump Tariffs LIVE Updates: Indian Markets Drop As US President Donald Trump's Tariff Sweep Offsets Earnings,"Trump Tariff LIVE Updates: US President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled an array of import levies that ranged as high as 41 per cent on Syria and included a hike on Canadian imports from the current 25 per cent to 35 per cent. Rates for India remained unchanged at 25 per cent, as announced by Trump earlier this week, but the duties for Pakistan have been slashed to 19 per cent, from the earlier 29 per cent.

This came after Trump said the US has struck a deal with India's neighbour, Pakistan, to jointly develop its oil reserves.

A range of new tariffs is due to take effect in one week, with separate sector-specific duties -- on copper -- also being implemented on trading partners.

Per Trump's order, the “universal” tariff for goods coming into the US will remain at 10 per cent, the same level that was implemented on April 2. However, that 10 per cent rate will apply only to countries with which the US has a trade surplus.

"""Highly Satisfying Moment"": ISRO Chief To NDTV On NISAR Satellite Launch","ISRO chairman Dr V Narayanan has expressed pride and relief after India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), successfully launched the $1.3 billion NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite aboard the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV F-16) rocket from Sriharikota on Wednesday. This mission marked a historic collaboration between two space-faring nations and showcases India's growing prowess in high-precision space technology.

The GSLV rocket, once dubbed the 'naughty boy of ISRO', now behaved like an obedient teenager. The success also brought cheers across ISRO, which saw two expensive failures this year.

""Each launch is very, very important for us. It's a new vehicle for us. To be frank, I was a little bit tense, but then I am relaxed now,"" Dr Narayanan told NDTV, reflecting on the tense moments leading up to lift off.

A Mission Of Many Firsts

The NISAR satellite is the most expensive civilian Earth imaging satellite ever built. It features a dual-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) payload-L-band built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and S-band developed by ISRO. The satellite also includes a 12-meter unfurlable umbrella-like antenna system, making it a technological marvel.

""This was the 102nd launch from Sriharikota and the 18th GSLV rocket launch. But for the first time, we launched to a sun-synchronous polar orbit. All other vehicles have been used for geosynchronous transfer orbit missions,"" Dr Narayanan explained, highlighting the uniqueness of the mission.

ISRO's role extended beyond payload development. ""ISRO is responsible for building the entire spacecraft-the structure, power system, inertial system, propulsion system-everything,"" he added.

A Symbol Of Indo-US Collaboration

The NISAR mission was nudged forward during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States, symbolizing the strength of Indo-US scientific collaboration. ""What a proud moment when PM Modi announced that the satellite built by both countries would be lifted off and placed in orbit by our rocket,"" Dr. Narayanan recalled.

The launch was executed with remarkable precision. ""The performance of the rocket was very precise. It was a highly satisfying and exciting moment for the entire ISRO community,"" he said.

Cryogenic Triumph

The mission also spotlighted India's mastery of cryogenic engine technology, a capability once denied to India under the technology denial regimes of the US. Dr. Narayanan shared his personal journey: ""When the program started, I was a junior engineer. After 20 years, when we succeeded, surely I had a role to play. But it is not an individual role. Almost 5,000 to 7,000 people contributed.""

He emphasised the collective effort behind the NISAR success: ""NASA and ISRO together working on a satellite system, and an Indian launcher developed by Indian scientists, industrial partners, lifted that satellite and placed it perfectly in orbit. What a satisfying and proud moment for all Indians across the globe.""

Operational Timeline And Global Impact

The satellite is currently healthy and operational. ""The solar panel is deployed and generating the required power. We are now in the process of unfurling the antenna and checking payload performance. In about 2.5 to 3 months, we will declare the satellite operational,"" Dr. Narayanan confirmed.

With a precise launch that saves on board satellite fuel, the NISAR satellite is now expected to serve for 6 to 7 years and will provide critical data for Earth observation, disaster management, agriculture, and climate studies. ""The entire global community is going to benefit from this satellite,"" he said.

NASA's Reaction and Future Missions

NASA was thrilled with the launch. ""They were extremely happy with the performance of the launcher. The satellite was injected correctly in its intended orbit,"" Dr. Narayanan noted.

India's Space Journey: From Dependence to Leadership

Reflecting on India's space journey, Dr. Narayanan said, ""Fifty years back, we built our first satellite with support from other countries. Today, our own launcher is placing the costliest satellite in the world in orbit. Strength only respects strength.""

"In Fresh Probe Against Anil Ambani, Rs 68 Crore Fake Bank Guarantee Charge","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has widened its ongoing investigation into alleged financial irregularities involving the Anil Ambani Group, launching a parallel probe into a fake bank guarantee case worth Rs 68.2 crore, NDTV Profit reported.

The ED on Thursday evening conducted a series of search operations across four premises -- three in Bhubaneswar and one in Kolkata -- that are connected to a firm identified as Biswal Tradelink Pvt Ltd, a relatively obscure entity now under scrutiny for allegedly operating a network of shell companies and issuing forged bank guarantees for commissions.

According to officials, Biswal Tradelink issued a fake bank guarantee to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), with the total value pegged at Rs 68.2 crore. The firm allegedly charged a commission of 8 per cent for fake bank guarantees.

The fraudsters used a spoofed domain, s-bi.co.in, designed to closely mimic the genuine domain of the State Bank of India (sbi.co.in). This cloned domain was allegedly used to deceive SECI and others by sending forged emails that appeared to be from the bank.

ED officials have recovered communication from the suspects showing that Telegram's disappearing message feature was actively used by the network to evade surveillance and maintain secrecy.

"Rain, Thunderstorms Likely In Delhi For Next 3 Days: Weather Office","The national capital is expected to witness a fresh spell of rain over the next three days, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate showers accompanied by thunderstorms between Friday and Sunday (August 3).

According to the IMD's Thursday bulletin, heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely over parts of the Northeast and adjoining eastern India over the next seven days. In Delhi, however, the intensity of rainfall is expected to decrease marginally starting Friday.

On Friday, Delhi will see very light to light rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms or lightning. Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain below normal, ranging between 33 to 35 degrees Celsius and 23 to 25 degrees Celsius, respectively.

Winds will initially blow from the northeast in the morning, shift to the southwest by afternoon, and then turn southeasterly in the evening and night, at speeds of 10-15 kmph.

Rainfall is expected to continue through August 2 and 3, with mostly cloudy skies and light showers accompanied by thunderstorms.

Daytime temperatures are likely to hover around 34 to 36 degrees Celsius, while night temperatures will range between 24 to 26 degrees Celsius, remaining a few degrees below the seasonal average. Winds will vary in direction but remain steady at 10-20 kmph, mostly from the northwest and northeast.

Earlier on Thursday, parts of Delhi received moderate rainfall, while isolated areas witnessed heavy showers that led to localised waterlogging and traffic congestion.

The maximum temperature recorded was 29.9 degrees Celsius five degrees below normal, while the minimum stood at 24.7 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the usual.

The IMD also noted that Delhi has been experiencing uneven rainfall over the past several days, which has caused significant inconvenience to daily commuters in multiple areas of the city.

With weather conditions remaining unstable and intermittent showers expected to persist, residents are advised to remain cautious, especially during peak travel hours.

Differences With India Can't Be Resolved Overnight For Trade Deal: US Official,"Differences between the US and India cannot be resolved overnight to arrive at a trade deal, a senior US official told reporters late on Thursday, citing geopolitical disagreements.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday Washington was still negotiating with India on trade after announcing earlier that day the US would impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from the country starting on Friday.

The 25% figure would single out India more severely than other major trading partners, and threaten to unravel months of talks between the two countries, undermining a strategic partner of Washington's and a counterbalance to China.

""Our challenges with India, they've always been a pretty closed market... there are a host of other kind of geopolitical issues,"" the US official said. ""You've seen the president express concern about, you know, membership in BRICS, purchases of Russian oil and that kind of thing.""

While saying there were constructive discussions with India, the official added: ""These are complex relationships and complex issues, and so I don't think things can be resolved overnight with India.""

India has faced pressure from the West, including the US, to distance itself from Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. New Delhi resisted that pressure, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and its economic needs.

Trump has cast the BRICS group of developing nations - of which India is a key part - as hostile to the US. Those nations have dismissed that accusation and the group says it promotes the interests of its members and of developing countries at large.

Trump has also drawn India's frustration by repeatedly taking credit for an India-Pakistan ceasefire that he announced on social media on May 10. The ceasefire halted days of hostilities between the nuclear armed Asian neighbors.

India's position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their issues directly without outside involvement.

Trump has reached a trade deal with India's rival Pakistan.

"Hot Air Balloon Rides Coming Soon To Delhi: Locations, Timeline, Other Info","Delhiites may soon get a bird's-eye view of the capital, with hot air balloon rides set to launch in the coming months at multiple sites across the city. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finalised locations and assigned operations to a private agency for a period of three years, extendable up to nine years.

The balloon rides will take off from four locations: Yamuna Sports Complex, Commonwealth Games Sports Complex, and two riverfront spots along the Yamuna Bank, Asita and Baansera.

Flights Expected to Start Within Two Months

The agency awarded the contract is expected to begin operations within two months. As per the plan, each balloon site will operate for up to four hours a day, though the flying window may be extended based on demand and DDA permissions.

Each of the four sites will allocate 3,600 square metres of land (60x60 metres) for the setup and launch of the balloons.

Revenue Sharing Model And Ticketing

The balloon rides will run on a revenue-sharing model between the DDA and the selected operator. While pricing is yet to be announced, it will be subject to DDA's final approval. Authorities said that to maintain transparency, all revenue from ticket sales will first be routed to the DDA's account.

DDA's Focus On Yamuna Riverfront

The initiative is part of a larger push by the DDA to make Delhi's natural and restored spaces more accessible for recreation and tourism.

Delhi's Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, who has been overseeing the broader Yamuna riverfront revival, said that the project is aimed at reconnecting citizens with the city's natural spaces.

The sites chosen are closely tied to the DDA's urban renewal efforts. Asita, once an encroached riverbank, has been reclaimed and turned into a landscaped green zone. Similarly, Baansera, located near Sarai Kale Khan, was previously a construction and demolition waste site. It has since been developed into Delhi's first bamboo-themed park, featuring over 30,000 bamboo plants, water bodies, and a musical fountain.

Notable Take-Off Points

Yamuna Sports Complex, Surajmal Vihar- DDA's largest sports complex.

Commonwealth Games Sports Complex- Built for the 2010 Games, now serving as a key public sports facility.

Asita and Baansera- Part of the Yamuna riverfront rejuvenation plan, offering a rare stretch of accessible green space in the capital.

Hot air balloon rides are a first-of-its-kind offering for Delhi, and officials hope the project will combine leisure with awareness about river conservation and urban ecology.

""This is not just an adventure activity, it's also a new way to connect people with the spaces we've been working hard to restore,"" a DDA official said

Final approvals on ticketing and operational logistics are expected soon.

"90% Of Farmers Fund Used To Fuel Cars, Not Crops In Madhya Pradesh: CAG","A fund meant to support farmers in their time of need was instead spent largely on fueling and maintaining government vehicles for five long years. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) dropped this political bombshell in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Thursday, revealing that the Fertilizer Development Fund created for farmers' welfare had become a virtual fuel tank for bureaucrats' cars.

From 2017-18 to 2021-22, across three state governments - two BJP regimes led by current Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and a 15-month Congress regime under Kamal Nath - 90 per cent of the Rs 5.31 crore fund (Rs 4.79 crore) was spent on vehicles, drivers' salaries, and maintenance at state and district levels. The actual benefits to farmers, such as fertiliser subsidies during natural calamities, training, or agricultural equipment, amounted to a mere Rs 5.10 lakh.

At the state level alone, Rs 2.77 crore was spent, including a staggering Rs 2.25 crore on just 20 vehicles. The CAG stressed that the Fertilizer Development Fund's (FDF) original mandate was to provide critical assistance to farmers, strengthen Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), and improve fertiliser management, not to become a transport budget.

The rot ran deeper. The CAG revealed that the MP State Cooperative Marketing Federation (Markfed) failed to pass on supplier rebates on Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) and Muriate of Potash (MOP) fertilisers to farmers, burdening them with an extra Rs 10.50 crore. In 2021-22, buying fertilisers at high rates and selling them cheaper to farmers led to a Rs 4.38 crore loss for Markfed, a blow ultimately borne by the public exchequer.

Defending the spending, the Cooperation Department's principal secretary claimed in February 2024 that vehicles were necessary for ""monitoring and supervision"" of fertiliser distribution. But the CAG dismissed this as unacceptable, saying vehicle expenses had overshadowed FDF's actual priorities.

Perhaps most shockingly, the government never assessed fertiliser needs using soil data, crop patterns, or district-level inputs. Instead, allocations were based on last year's consumption, ignoring vast areas under vegetables and horticulture from 2017-22.",2025-08-01 10:47:12.394999,"A fund meant to support farmers in their time of need was instead spent largely on fueling and maintaining government vehicles for five long years.

'Ended 1 Conflict A Month': White House Demands Nobel Peace Prize For Trump,"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed on Thursday (local time) that US President Donald Trump has brokered several peace deals and ceasefires in several conflict zones across the world. Saying that the peace deals, which average to one per month, Ms Leavitt reiterated the call for the Nobel Peace Prize to be awarded to the US President.

The White House Press Secretary made the remarks during the press briefing.

Beginning her remarks with the Thailand-Cambodia conflict, Leavitt said, ""On the peace front, President Trump helped deliver an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia. The two countries were engaged in a deadly conflict that had displaced more than 300,000 people until President Trump stepped in to put an end to it.""

The ceasefire agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), who mediated talks between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai at his official residence near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, CNN reported.

She further added that the US President ""spoke directly on the phone with the acting Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, to inform both the leaders that unless they brought the conflict to an end, there would be no trade discussions or agreements with the United States. Almost immediately afterwards, a peace was brokered that will save thousands of lives and allowed for trade negotiations with these countries to resume, and they have.""

Karoline Leavitt then said, ""The President has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia. This means President Trump has brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It is well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.""

Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for stopping hostilities between India and Pakistan after New Delhi's effective response to Islamabad's aggression following precision strikes on terror infrastructure.

However, India refuted the claims made by the US President, reiterating its policy that India and Pakistan bilaterally address any matter related to the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while speaking in the Lok Sabha during the Operation Sindoor discussion, emphasised that no world leader told India to stop its operation.

""No leader in the world told India to stop its operation. On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer...,"" PM Modi said.

India launched Operation Sindoor early on May 7 and hit terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoJK in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 civilians were killed. India repelled subsequent Pakistani military aggression and pounded its airbases.

India and Pakistan agreed to a cessation of hostilities following a call made by Pakistan's DGMO to his Indian counterpart.

"Trump Releases Revised Tariffs: India Remains At 25%, Pak's Rate Slashed","US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order slapping higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners ahead of a Friday trade deal deadline -- his latest bid to reshape global trade in favour of US businesses. The higher import duty rates from 10 per cent to 41 per cent are set to start in seven days for 69 trading partners, according to the order.

The duties ranged as high as 41 per cent on Syria, 35 per cent on many goods from Canada, 50 per cent for Brazil, 25 per cent for India, 20 per cent for Taiwan and 39 per cent for Switzerland. Meanwhile, duties on Pakistan imports have been slashed from 29 per cent to 19 per cent.

This was alongside various levels of duties reflecting trade deals struck between Washington and major partners like the European Union and Japan. The order said that goods from all other countries not listed in an annex would be subject to a 10 per cent US tariff rate.

More Deals On The Way

Trump's order said that some trading partners, ""despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.""

Officials from the Trump administration told reporters that more trade deals were yet to be announced as Trump's higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates were set to take effect.

""We have some deals,"" the official said. ""And I don't want to get ahead of the President of the United States in announcing those deals.""

Canada And Mexico

An exemption for Canadian and Mexican goods entering the country under a North American trade pact remained in place, according to the White House.

The Trump administration issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35 per cent from 25 per cent previously, saying Canada, the second-largest US trading partner after Mexico, had ""failed to cooperate"" in curbing fentanyl flows into the US.

The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump's decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30 per cent on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.

Meanwhile, the extension for Mexico avoids a 30 per cent tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.

Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50 per cent tariff on Mexican steel, aluminium and copper and a 25 per cent tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.

""Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post without providing details.

Brazil

Trump hit Brazil on Wednesday with a steep 50 per cent tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America's largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.

South Korea And India

South Korea agreed on Wednesday to accept a 15 per cent tariff on its exports to the U.S., including autos, down from a threatened 25 per cent, as part of a deal that includes a pledge to invest $350 billion in US projects to be chosen by Trump.

But goods from India appeared to be headed for a 25 per cent tariff after talks bogged down over access to India's agriculture sector, drawing a higher-rate threat from Trump that also included an unspecified penalty for India's purchases of Russian oil.

Although negotiations with India were continuing, New Delhi vowed to protect the country's labour-intensive farm sector, triggering outrage from the opposition party and a slump in the rupee.

China

Looming over the global economy is also an unresolved trade tussle between the United States and China. Beijing is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump's administration, after the two largest economies reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.

The silent engine behind every cancer cure: why everyone should care about research,"“Today’s research is tomorrow’s cure.”

- S. Krishnamurthi (advisor, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar and doyen in the field of surgical oncology).

Every gain in survival, every reduction in side effects, and every new hope offered to families comes from decades of careful investigation and relentless inquiry. The complex field of cancer keeps evolving because of research. Research is carried out with the never-ending hope that somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. This curiosity of scientists, driven by courage and strewn with challenges, has shaped the scientific advances we see today, says Pandurangan Vijayanand, director of research, Cancer Institute (WIA).

The evolving landscape of research

Every cancer treatment that saves a life today, whether it is a precise beam of radiation, a novel surgery, or a life-extending drug, was made possible through decades of research. Some of it began in laboratories, where scientists uncovered the genetic, molecular, and cellular secrets of cancer. Equally important, much of it unfolded in hospitals, through clinical trials and patient-centred studies led by doctors, nurses, and multidisciplinary care teams. While scientists and physicians may work in different settings, they share a common goal: to improve patient outcomes.

Vijayalakshmi Ramshankar, professor and head, department of cancer biology and molecular diagnostics, emphasises thatcancer research is not a straight line from lab to clinic; it is a continuous, collaborative cycle in which laboratory discoveries inform clinical practice, and real-world observations at the bedside spark new questions in the lab.

Yet for the public, research can seem abstract or distant. It is often imagined as something done in sterile labs, far removed from everyday life. In truth, research is the invisible force that powers everything in modern cancer care, says Sabitha Ramanathan, professor and head, department of molecular oncology. Like invisible roots beneath the soil that nourish the whole tree, research nourishes the branches of innovation and discovery. It shapes how we diagnose, treat, prevent, and even talk about cancer.

From generalised care to precision oncology

Not long ago, cancer treatment followed a one-size-fits-all approach. Most patients received similar combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Today, we are firmly in the era of precision oncology, where treatments are tailored to the genetic and molecular makeup of each patient’s tumour, and this treatment plan has been vetted and approved after intense discussion at multidisciplinary meetings called tumour boards. Targeted therapies, for example, attack specific mutations that drive cancer growth while sparing healthy cells. Drugs like imatinib and trastuzumab have transformed outcomes in diseases such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and HER2-positive breast cancer.

These breakthroughs came from years of basic science, drug development, and clinical trials. Just as importantly, they were supported by data on how these treatments work across different populations and health systems, helping ensure that innovation benefits everyone, not just a few.

Safer, smarter delivery of treatment

One of the most remarkable developments in recent years is immunotherapy, a treatment that harnesses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown dramatic results in cancers like skin and lung cancer, where survival has improved for the first time in decades. CAR-T cell therapy takes it a step further by genetically modifying a patient’s T cells to target their cancer directly. While currently used in certain types of blood cancer, research is underway to expand these therapies to more patients and cancer types.

Research has also changed how treatments are delivered. Surgery has become more precise with robotic assistance and minimally invasive techniques that reduce pain and shorten recovery times. In radiation oncology, newer technologies such as image-guided radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and proton beam therapy enable doctors to target tumors with exceptional accuracy. This means fewer complications, especially in children and in cancers located near sensitive organs like the brain or spinal cord.

India’s expanding role in research

India, with its vast and diverse population, is well positioned to make significant contributions to global cancer research. Increasingly, Indian institutions are leading clinical trials that reflect our realities, including affordability, infrastructure, and cultural factors. Efforts include repurposing inexpensive, off-patent drugs; evaluating shortened treatment courses; and generating real-world evidence from both urban and rural settings.

The Indian Paediatric Haematology Oncology Group (INPHOG) has developed and tested protocols suited explicitly to local children. National cancer registries now generate critical data that guide policies and help international partners better understand cancer trends in low- and middle-income countries.

Every screening guideline, every side effect averted, every treatment that improves survival began with a research question. Even in palliative care, the process of easing pain and supporting dignity at the end of life, has evolved through studies aimed at improving our approach.

Looking ahead

Despite all the progress, cancer remains a leading cause of death in India and worldwide. The burden is expected to grow. That makes continued research not just important, but critical. We need better prevention strategies, early detection, shorter and safer treatments, and solutions that work in real-world environments. Patients, caregivers, communities, and policymakers all play a crucial role. Participating in studies, advocating for research funding, donating to medical science, or simply asking doctors about the latest evidence -- these actions collectively strengthen the ecosystem that advances cancer care.

As we look toward a future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), personalized medicine, and wearable health monitors, compassion and curiosity must continue to guide us. In a world where cancer affects nearly every family, investing in research is seeking the science that is truth, which is a moral imperative.

2018 Abirami case: How a T.N. court reasoned against death penalty for mother who poisoned her two children in Chennai | Explained,"The story so far: The Kancheepuram Principal District and Sessions Court on July 24, 2025 convicted V. Abirami of Kundrathur near Chennai for having killed her six-year-old son V. Ajay and four-year-old daughter V. Karnika. The court was convinced that the woman had drugged her children to death at the instance of a biriyani outlet employee Sundaram alias R. Meenakshisundaram with whom she had an extra-marital affair. Though there was no eye-witness to the crime, the prosecution had successfully proved the charges against both the convicts through a strong and unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence. Yet, the trial court did not award the maximum punishment of death sentence to the convicts by quoting Mahatma Gandhi to have said that an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.

What was the prosecution’s case?

According to the Kundrathur police, the prime convict Abirami had married bank loan mediator Vijay on January 8, 2011 after falling in love with him and obtaining the consent of both families. The married couple had two kids and the family lived in a rented house on the first floor of a building at Moondram Kattalai near Chennai. In 2018, the woman had developed an intimacy with Meenakshisundaram and it led to strains in the marital relationship with her husband. About 20 days before killing her kids, Abirami had gone missing from her matrimonial home. While her husband, father and brother were clueless about her whereabouts, Ajay told them that she often visits the nearby residence of “an uncle (Meenakshisundaram).” He also stated that he could identify that house. Using the kid’s assistance, they tracked her down and brought her back home. Ever since this incident, she began expressing an hostile attitude towards her children and eventually killed them by offering milk laced with drugs, the prosecution claimed.

In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined Vijay who told the court that Abirami had offered the poisoned milk to him too on the night of August 30, 2018. However, he refused to drink it since it did not taste good. Thereafter, he slept till 12 noon on August 31, 2018. He left the house for work only in the afternoon and returned early morning on September 1, 2018, after completing night duty. Then, he witnessed the bodies of his two kids on the bed and claimed that his wife was not at home.

How did the police corroborate the evidence?

A government doctor, who conducted postmortem on the two bodies, did not find any external injuries. Hence, she removed the stomach, intestine, liver and kidneys from both the bodies and sent them to clinical toxicology wing. A scientific officer from the toxicology wing confirmed the presence of the drugs Lorazepam and Alprazolam in the organs and therefore, it was concluded that the deaths had occurred due to systemic absorption of the drugs used for sleeping difficulties and anxiety disorders.

The police promptly caught hold of the pharmacist from whom Abirami had purchased the drugs by producing a medical prescription. He had submitted the bill book and identified her. The police also examined a jeweller to whom Abirami had sold a gold chain for ₹17,000 on August 31, 2018 before she fled to Nagercoil in Kanniyakumari district. A supervisor at a two-wheeler stand at Koyambedu mofussil bus terminus had deposed that she had parked her two-wheeler at the stand on the evening of August 31, 2018 and handed over the CCTV footage too.

Did the woman confess to have committed the crime?

When the trial court questioned Abirami regarding the charges levelled against her by the police for the double murder of her own kids, she stoutly denied them and claimed to be innocent. It was her case that there was no direct evidence/eye witness to the crime and that she could not be convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Her counsel argued that the last seen theory (the deceased children having been seen alive last in the custody of their mother) could also not be pressed in the present case in order to impose the obligation on her, under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, to prove as to how did the kids die.

Which of the factors convinced the trial court with respect to her guilt?

The trial court pointed out that the prosecution had examined multiple independent witnesses such as the pharmacist, jeweller and two-wheeler stand supervisor to prove its case. Further, it had also examined a cook working at a women’s hostel in Nagercoil. The cook had categorically deposed that Abirami had come to the hostel early morning on September 1, 2018 and requested for a room. On being told that the manager would come only by 5:30 pm, she intially agreed to wait till then. Thereafter, she took permission to take bath in one of the rooms and immediately fled from the hostel. The cook was a complete stranger to Abirami and there was no reason as to why she should give a false testimony against her, the trial court said.

Further, a tenant who resides on the ground floor of the same building where Abirami too resides had deposed about the illicit relationship between the two convicts and claimed to have warned Abirami on a couple of occassions. After her arrest on September 2, 2018, police had taken Abirami to her Moondram Kattalai residence from where she had picked up the tablet strips, which she had used to kill the children, and handed them over to the investigating officer. Abirami’s paternal uncle and another relative were witness to this recovery of the unused tablets from her residence, the trial court pointed out.

A paternal uncle, being someone like a father figure, would again have no reason to give a false testimony against her, the trial court said.

How did the trial court reason against capital punishment?

The trial judge Pa.U. Chemmal agreed that it was a heartrending murder of two innocent kids by none other than their mother just because they were perceived to be an hindrance to her illicit relationship. He said, the two convicts certainly do not deserve any mercy. “Yet, we should not hang them to death,” the judge said, and quoted Mahatma Gandhi to have said, man has no right to take away the life given by God.

In the same breath, the judge said, a mere life sentence, which may entail the benefit of remission, might also not be an appropriate punishment for the offence committed by the convicts. Therefore, he ordered that the convicts must remain incarcerated till the end of their lives. That would be a judicially fair decision, he concluded.",2025-08-01 04:47:07+00:00,"About 20 days before killing her kids, Abirami had gone missing from her matrimonial home.

"Parole of ‘Kodi’ Suni, convict in T.P. Chandrasekharan murder case, cancelled for bail violation","The parole of ‘Kodi’ Suni, convicted in the T.P Chandrasekharan murder case, has been cancelled after he violated bail conditions by failing to report to the Meenangadi police station in Wayanad, Kerala.

Acting on a report from the Meenangadi Circle Inspector Santhosh Kumar, Suni, who was granted 15-day emergency parole on July 21, was taken back to Kannur Central Jail on Thursday (July 31, 2025) night.

Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that as per the parole conditions, he should have stayed within the Meenangadi police station limits. However after reporting once, he was found staying in a resort within the Kenichira police limits, bordering Kannur and Wayanad, which was a violation of the conditions. This was promptly reported to the District Police Chief and a report was submitted, he added.

The incident has also intensified concerns over repeated security breaches at the Kannur prison. Three civil police officers – Vysakh, Vineesh and Jishnu of the AR camp – were suspended recently following a departmental enquiry that found the accused consumed alcohol while in police custody.

The incident occurred on July 17 when Suni, along with fellow accused Muhammed Rafi and Shinoj, was taken to the Thalassery Additional District Court. During the lunch break, the accused were allegedly allowed to have food at a nearby hotel, where their friends reportedly served them alcohol in the presence of police officers.

This is not the first security concern linked to Suni. He was previously accused of assaulting a jail warden who had questioned him about mobile phone use inside the prison. Following repeated violations, Suni was shifted to the 10th block of Kannur Central Jail, an area previously flagged for multiple security lapses.

"‘Anything that moves, NASA-ISRO satellite will see with unprecedented fidelity’","On July 31, the India-US space collaboration crossed a historic milestone with the successful launch of NISAR, or the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite, a flagship earth observation mission jointly developed by the two nations’ space programmes. It is the first satellite to use radars of two frequencies — the L-band radar by NASA and the S-band radar by ISRO — to continuously monitor the earth’s surface. NISAR is expected to provide unprecedented data on land deformation, ice-sheet dynamics, forest biomass, and natural disasters like earthquakes and floods. With its high-resolution, all-weather, day-night imaging capabilities, NISAR aims to enhance climate resilience, agricultural monitoring, and disaster response. Beyond science, NISAR also holds commercial promise to enable new data services, geospatial analytics, and early-warning systems across sectors such as insurance, infrastructure, and agriculture.

To discuss this scientific milestone and what this means for space cooperation, Vasudevan Mukunth and Kunal Shankar spoke to Karen St. Germain. Dr. St. Germain is the director of the Earth Science Division at the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, where she oversees NASA’s full earth science portfolio, including satellite missions, technology, applied research, and data-to‑action programs.

Vasudevan Mukunth: Karen, thank you so much for joining us today. Can you give us a few examples of scientific studies that are possible with NISAR, but haven’t been possible so far with the existing crop of Earth observation satellites?

Karen St. Germain: Absolutely, and it’s great to be with you. The way to think about NISAR is that it will see anything that has structure to it that moves, that changes its position at a scale of less than a centimeter over an area about half of a tennis court. When I say anything that has structure: it could be forest, it could be buildings, it could be glaciers, mountains, land. Anything that moves, we’ll see at an unprecedented level of fidelity.

What that means is we will be able to see the slight bulging that happens before a volcano erupts. We’ll be able to see the land becoming unstable before a landslide. We’ll be able to see building shifts after an earthquake or any other sort of event. When a forest gets cut down, we’ll be able to see that. Anything that changes, we’ll be able to see, and that’s an extraordinary new capability for us.

Kunal Shankar: After the launch, NISAR will start its 90-day commissioning phase. And this is the world’s first dual band SAR satellite. In this phase, do you foresee any challenges with calibration, especially with cross-band calibration? Could you break down that process for us?

Karen St. Germain: There are a number of different aspects to the calibration. Largely the ISRO team will focus on calibrating the S-band radar and the NASA team will focus on calibrating the L-band radar. They don’t really get cross-calibrated, but each one will look at its own special targets.

Now, what do I mean by a target? It’s something we call a corner reflector and it is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a corner, just like the corner of a room. And it has a special feature, which is that when a pulse of energy hits it from any direction, it reflects back in exactly the same direction. So we use these targets to calibrate independently each of the instruments. And then the only other thing we really have to pay special attention to is the alignment, the pointing. Are they pointing in the same place on the ground? And for that, we’ll use the data itself. So the data itself will identify features and we’ll align those features from each radar.

Vasudevan Mukunth: So NASA’s investment in NISAR is about $1.2 billion, right?

Karen St. Germain: That’s about right.

Vasudevan Mukunth: If possible, could you tell us how this cost breaks down on the US side?

Karen St. Germain: The way NASA builds missions, we establish a life cycle cost. So that life cycle starts when we start designing and it runs through the design phase, the build, the integration, the launch, and all the way through — what we call the prime mission, which for NISAR is the first three years. For NISAR, that included the deployable antenna, which is the most distinguishing feature of NISAR, and the L-band radar. And of course, the L-band and the S-band are operating through the same reflector. Then of course, there are various electronics and data handling elements as well.

And then there are the people, right? The people that put it all together and worked so closely with the team from India. So even after we were finished building our part, our team came to India to work with ISRO to integrate it onto the spacecraft and prepare for launch and even sat on the console for the launch. So it’s a total cost.

Kunal Shankar: Speaking of costs, there’s a lot of interest about the commercial aspect and the applications aspect of NISAR. Could you just tell us a bit about the kind of interest that it has generated?

Karen St. Germain: Actually, let me take a step back and talk about earth observation data in general because understanding the earth — the surface, the atmosphere, and the changes large and small that can have impacts on communities and businesses, that’s become an enormous area of interest. In fact, NASA’s been collecting data on the earth system for more than 60 years now. And we find that about three quarters of our Fortune 100 companies are drawing something out of that earth observation archive. We also find that about 75% of our users, and we have more than 5 million users, are coming from .com addresses. So we are talking about agriculture producers, the insurance industry, the finance industry, the transportation industry. And that’s before you even get to things like disaster response. So we have a tremendous interest in general.

For NISAR specifically, we know that NISAR will produce data that can directly benefit agriculture, also risk assessment — everything from natural hazards like earthquakes and volcanoes, which are both issues in the US but also things like wildfire risk because NISAR will be able to characterise how much fuel is in our wildlands. So that’s dry fuel that is burnable. There are all these application areas. One of the things that we do that we’re really excited about is any time we launch a new mission, we have an Early Adopters program. These are people out there who anticipate what NISAR might do for them in their business. We don’t require that they tell us a lot about what they intend to do. But right now for NISAR, we have at least 200 of these Early Adopters. Once the data start to roll out and the excitement builds, we expect it to take off from there.

Kunal Shankar: Which you believe is a high number.

Karen St. Germain: The Early Adopters, yeah. It’s a high number for a mission that is as sophisticated as NISAR. What I mean by that is: pictures are generally easy for people to use. Synthetic aperture radar data requires some pretty complex processing to turn it into usable information. But all the data is free and openly available from us. We will distribute the L-band data out of the Alaska SAR facility and our colleagues at ISRO will have their own distribution mechanism for the S-band data, and it will also be open and freely available.

Vasudevan Mukunth: Two-hundred is a big number. Also, can you explain why NISAR took 11 years to build? Were there any particularly difficult engineering challenges that you had to overcome first?

Karen St. Germain: Yeah, absolutely. First, it’s an enormously complex system, with many dozens of subassemblies that had to be designed. Of course, to make these two radars work together and operate through a single reflector, there’s a lot of design work that had to happen up front. So it was challenging to begin with. And then we had a couple of other particular challenges. This one happened right as I was starting my job: COVID hit. So think about an integrated engineering team already separated by time zones and distance and now having to work through a global pandemic. A lot of this work also had to happen in person. We had people who had to travel at the height of COVID, and had to leave their families. Remember that the waves of COVID hit differently in the US and India. We had people on both teams sometimes come down with COVID when they were in the opposite country, so we had to take care of one another’s teams. Then we had to develop entirely new protocols for how people could work together in a space and remain healthy. That was a big one.

More recently, this reflector is enormous, it’s about a 40-foot deployable reflector. And when we were in India integrating and we were testing in the thermal vacuum, we saw some data that worried us. We were really afraid that there may be too much of a thermal load on that reflector before it gets deployed, and it might overheat. If it did that, it could challenge the structural integrity. Of course, when you’ve got a deployable antenna, if it doesn’t stay taut, it doesn’t reflect the way you want it to. So we ended up de-mating that reflector, bringing it back home, applying a reflective coating so the sun couldn’t cause it to overheat, on the struts (not on the reflector surface itself). Then we had to ship it back and reintegrate. So we had a couple of technical challenges, which we expect when you’re doing something as difficult as this.

Kunal Shankar: Speaking of challenges, what do you think are the limitations in terms of penetration depth of the L-band versus the S-band?

Karen St. Germain: I would not frame it so much in terms of limitations as I would frame it that they are both specialists and they just have different specialties. So the L-band has a longer wavelength and that means it can penetrate deeper. It can penetrate through foliage. Of course they’ll both be able to create imagery in day and night through clouds and weather. It’s just that when there is some material there like foliage, the L-band will penetrate further: it will interact with larger structures. The S-band will give you more information about that foliage because it’s more sensitive to it. That’s just one example. They will really just see different things. And their power then will be when we combine the information from them and get a more holistic holistic view, right?

Vasudevan Mukunth: This is kind of a follow up to that. Both the L-band and the S-band radars use the same reflector. Since S-band has a shorter wavelength than the L-band, does this create any trade-offs in either L-band or S-band performance?

Karen St. Germain: It doesn’t. And the reason for that is because this is a synthetic aperture radar. It creates its spatial resolution as it moves along. Each radar is taking snapshots as it moves along. You know, to get this kind of centimetre level fidelity and the kind of spatial resolution we’re achieving, if you were to use a solid antenna, it would have to be five miles long. Just like when you’re talking about a camera, if you want to be able to get high fidelity, you need a big lens. Same idea. But we can’t deploy an antenna that big. So what we do is we build up image after image after image to get that resolution. And because of this technique, it’s actually independent of wavelength. It works the same for S- and for L-bands. The only thing that’s a little different is because the antenna feeds for the L-band and the S-band can’t physically occupy the same space, they have to be next to each other and that means there’s a slight difference in the way their pulses reflect off the antenna. There’s that positioning difference, and that we can correct for.

Vasudevan Mukunth: Could you tell us a little bit more about that slight difference?

Karen St. Germain: It’s the way a reflector works. You would ideally want to put the feed at the focal point of the reflector. But when you have two feeds, you can’t do that. So they’re slightly offset. That means they illuminate the reflector just slightly differently. The alignment is just a little bit different. The team optimised the design to minimise that difference and to make it so that they could correct it in post-processing.

Kunal Shankar: How do NASA and JPL’s radar systems for planetary exploration feed into and evolve from their Earth observation systems? And even at the moon, NASA and ISRO have been collaborating specifically using radar systems on the DFSAR on Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and the Mini-RF on LRO. Can we imagine a NISAR built for missions to the moon, Mars or beyond?

Karen St. Germain: Of course, once you have expertise in a technology, you can use it in many, many ways. And this is often the case in NASA between earth science and planetary science. One of us will develop a new technology or advance a new technology and then it can be used very broadly. So absolutely! And we love that kind of interplay. I love seeing earth science technologies make it into planetary missions.

That’s one aspect. The other thing is what we learn from NISAR on earth can inform what we understand about other planets. There are lots of ways that we interact across disciplines.

Vasudevan Mukunth: Could you give us an example of a lesson that you would learn from NISAR that would help with the planetary mission?

Karen St. Germain: Let’s see. One of the things that NISAR is going to tell us about is what’s going on underneath the crust of the surface because we’ll be able to see these very small motions that you and I don’t experience daily, right? We can’t sense these. But NISAR will, and it will allow us to advance our models about how the interior of planets work. And those kinds of models are the same models we use when we try to understand how a planet like Mars works.

Vasudevan Mukunth: NISAR is a first of its kind equal partnership between NASA and ISRO. Can you tell us what kind of precedent this collaboration sets for future major collaborations or technology sharing between the two organisations?

Karen St. Germain: First, I will say I have been singularly focused on getting NISAR off the ground and not really looking beyond. Of course, you know, when I was preparing for launch, I went and bought a little figure of Ganesh. Because my understanding is that Ganesh brings good tidings for the beginning of an enterprise.

And for as long as we’ve been working on NISAR, the launch really represents the beginning of that collaboration. We will be working together closely for many years just to extract all the value out of NISAR. But as you said, NASA and ISRO are working together in many ways in human exploration and potentially in other areas. I hope, and I think that, we will have a rich collaboration for a very long time and I think it will span the areas of interest from earth science to planetary science and human exploration.",2025-08-01 04:29:52+00:00,"It is the first satellite to use radars of two frequencies — the L-band radar by NASA and the S-band radar by ISRO — to continuously monitor the earth’s surface.
To discuss this scientific milestone and what this means for space cooperation, Vasudevan Mukunth and Kunal Shankar spoke to Karen St. Germain.
Dr. St. Germain is the director of the Earth Science Division at the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, where she oversees NASA’s full earth science portfolio, including satellite missions, technology, applied research, and data-to‑action programs.
Largely the ISRO team will focus on calibrating the S-band radar and the NASA team will focus on calibrating the L-band radar.
Karen St. Germain: Of course, once you have expertise in a technology, you can use it in many, many ways.","['fidelity', 'germain', 'satellite', 'reflector', 'unprecedented', 'moves', 'radar', 'nisar', 'lband', 'data', 'st', 'nasaisro', 'sband', 'earth', 'science']",['Authors'],https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/anything-that-moves-nasa-isro-satellite-will-see-with-unprecedented-fidelity/article69881443.ece,The Hindu
"India cannot remain ‘mute spectator’ as institutions like WTO are destroyed, says Congress","The Congress on Friday (August 1, 2025) asserted that India has the highest stakes in institutions such as the WTO and WHO which are being ""destroyed"" and ""gutted"" by U.S. President Donald Trump, and cannot remain a mute spectator while being content with coining slogans and acronyms.

Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had been dealt very heavy blows during Mr. Trump-I.

""It has been destroyed during Trump-II. The rules-based, multilateral trading system put in place with the US itself playing a leadership role has been finished off,"" Mr. Ramesh claimed.

The U.S.'s approach now is to negotiate — if at all--bilaterally but finally decide unilaterally, the Congress leader said in a post on X.

President Trump has also gutted the WHO and withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement and UNESCO, Ramesh said.

""India has the highest stakes in such international accords and institutions. It cannot remain a mute spectator and be content with coining slogans and acronyms,"" Mr. Ramesh said.

His remarks came after President Trump issued an executive order listing the various duties that Washington will impose on exports from countries around the world.

India will face tariffs of 25% on its exports to the U.S.

The executive order, however, does not mention the penalty that Mr. Trump had said India will have to pay because of its purchases of Russian military equipment and energy.

On Wednesday (July 30, 2025), Mr. Trump, through a post on his social media website Truth Social, announced the 25% tariff on India and an additional penalty for New Delhi's purchases from Russia.

While August 1 was the tariff deadline, the new levies will come into effect from August 7.

In April, Mr. Trump had announced that India will face a 26% discounted reciprocal tariff, a per cent higher than the rate announced now.

In its reaction to the U.S.' tariff announcement, India has said it will take all necessary steps to safeguard and promote national interest and that the implications of the tariffs are being examined.",2025-08-01 04:22:39+00:00,"Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had been dealt very heavy blows during Mr. Trump-I.

AIDSO demands impartial probe into death of Odisha student in Kalaburagi,"All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has called for an impartial investigation into the death of Jayashree Nayak, a final-year B.Sc geology student from Odisha, at the Central University of Karnataka hostel in Kadaganchi, Aland taluk of Kalaburagi district in Karnataka.

Jayashree, a fifth-semester undergraduate student, was found dead in her hostel room on July 30.

The incident has once again raised troubling questions over mental health and emotional well-being of students in premier academic institutions.

In a statement issued by AIDSO district secretary Tulajaram N.K., the organisation expressed deep shock over the growing number of student deaths in Central universities and institutions of higher learning across India.

“This is not an isolated case. The increasing frequency of such incidents points to the worsening campus environment that breeds fear and anxiety among students,” Mr. Tulajaram claimed.

He further said that it is critical for the university administration and authorities to act with urgency and transparency. “We demand a fair and impartial inquiry into the circumstances leading to this tragedy. Immediate steps should be taken to prevent recurrence,” he said.

AIDSO emphasised the need for strong support systems on campus, including accessible and empathetic counselling services, and the creation of a more supportive and pressure-free academic environment.

“Students must feel safe, heard and supported, not overwhelmed by academic and social pressures,” according to the statement.

The district unit of AIDSO has urged the university authorities and the government to take this matter seriously and ensure justice for the deceased student while addressing broader issues impacting student mental health.",2025-08-01 04:18:29+00:00,"All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has called for an impartial investigation into the death of Jayashree Nayak, a final-year B.Sc geology student from Odisha, at the Central University of Karnataka hostel in Kadaganchi, Aland taluk of Kalaburagi district in Karnataka.
